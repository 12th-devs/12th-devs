## I'm 12th ✌🏻  
Just a guy with way too much free time who really wants to learn JavaScript.  
Not much of a tech stack yet, but I’ve *vibecoded* and started way too many WIP projects.

## About Me  
I’m an 13yr old guy and I really like browsers and web development.  
Sometimes I try to build things that probably shouldn't work... but they do (sometimes).

## Tech Stack  
Still learning, but here's what I use so far:  
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (kinda), learning Rust - slowly
- **Tools:** VS Code, GitHub, Firefox DevTools
- **Other Stuff:** Node.js (sometimes), Figma, ChatGPT if you count that
- **Browser:** Zen, best browser around.

## Stats 
[![12th-dev's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=12th-devs)](https://github.com/12th-devs/github-readme-stats)

## Projects  
Some of my favorite WIP projects: 
- **[Advanced Tab Groups](https://github.com/Anoms12/Advanced-Tab-Groups)** –  Improves Tab Folders & Groups for Zen Browser
- **[Zen Tidy Downloads](https://github.com/Anoms12/Zen-Tidy-Downloads)** – Rename your downloads with ease, and do it in style!
- **[Zen Library](https://github.com/Anoms12/Zen-Library)** –  A new way to manage Zen, inigrated with your favorite mods 
- **[KLWE](https://github.com/Anoms12/Kustom-Web-Editor)** –  Web Editor For The Kustom App Suite

> Some of these mods have been transfered to the Vertex Mods inititive, a group of modders for Zen Browser all making amazing, high quality mods.

*I've got a lot of other stuff in my vault, but time will tell what I do*
